Ever heard about **Hanami** framework? If not, let me introduce you to this amazing framework. Hanami is formerly named as **Lotus**, [but for some reason](http://hanamirb.org/blog/2016/01/22/lotus-is-now-hanami.html) they changed the name into **Hanami**.

What we going to talk in this blog post is clearly described by the title of this blog post.

A couple months ago, I got a task from my supervisor to explore new framework, and that's **Hanami**.
